# Feature specific
- lambdas can be used in initializers for fields and variables
(e.g. X x = () -> { ... };)
- lambdas can be used in assignments for fields and variables
(e.g. X x; x = () -> { ... };)
- lambdas can be used as method arguments
(e.g. testMethod(() -> { ... }, 1, "String");
- lambdas can be returned (e.g. return () -> { ... };

# General feautures
- Multiple variables, fields, methods and classes with the same name cannot be
  declared in the same scope
- Can only use variables that are in scope
- Use of variables only after declaration
- Use of variables only after initialisation
- Variable initializers and assignments have to be type compatible
